# Excluding Intervals

This project is an attempt at working with intervals. Intervals can be merged, excluded.

Minimum requirements:

- Node v20.12.0
- NPM 10.7.0

Get the code from here:
```

```

You can then install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```

At this point, you should be able to run the commandline interface:

```
node cli.js
```

You'll be prompted to enter the includes and excludes.

```
prompt: includes:  10-20, 15-30
prompt: excludes:  12-18
10-11, 19-30
```

Optionally, you can run the tests:

```
